# Whoops, it thinks libintel_npu_acceleration_library.so is an importable dynamic module since
# it lives in the Python source tree. It is not that, becuase this package is weird.
# Maybe we should move it to the system wide libdir or libexec?
# For now disable the import check and hope nobody tries to import it!
